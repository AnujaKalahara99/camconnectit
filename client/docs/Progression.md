## 🗓️ Progress Log

### 📅 [2025-05-06]

#### ✅ What I Did
- Backtrack to initial UI commit in v1 branch and created new dev branch
- Remove most of unwanted code
- Added certificates with **mkcert**, but next dev still uses --experimental-https 
- Got camera stream working cross device

#### 🧠 Learnings / Insights
Most important thing I learnt was the certificates and secured http. Also how actually WebRTC framework works. Because cross device had to use a free google SRUN server to share ICE candidates.

#### 🛠️ TODO / Next Steps
- clean public folder and styles
- capturing pictures
- media transfer
